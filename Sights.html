                <p class="fontsize2">The post Renaissance Spain still had lots of marks in both literature, art and architecture. An example of a city with a lot of renaissance architecture is The city of Salamanca, a city near the Tormes river and full of beautiful Renaissance architecture. Nearby the city square you can find bars, cafes, restaurants and cathedrals all made out of sandstone which gives the city its identity and name “La Dorada” or “Golden City” in Spanish.</p>

Casco Histórico de Toledo or The Old Town Of Toledo is a part of the city that has a scent of the past. The town is an important part of the world, making it one of the UNESCO world heritage centers. The town is so old that there is a 900 year old mosque called the Mezquita de las Tornerías, an ancient church called Iglesia de la Magdalena and a synagogue called Sinagoga de Santa María La Blanca.  </p>
