        When the Renaissance began to spread from Italy made it clear that the era would leave a mark in both literature, art and architecture. The city of Salamanca is a city near the Tormes river and full of beautiful Renaissance architecture. Nearby the city square you can find bars, cafes, restaurants and cathedrals all made out of sandstone which gives the city its identity and name “La Dorada” or “Golden City” in Spanish.
